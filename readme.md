Certainly! Here's an example readme for this tool:

# Code Summarization Tool

This tool generates a summary of a directory's contents, including a tree view of its subdirectories and files, and the contents of each file. It can optionally exclude files listed in a .gitignore file and exclude or include Docker files.

## Usage

To use this tool, run the following command:

```
python summarize_directory.py <directory_path> [--gitignore <gitignore_path>] [-d|--show_docker] [-o|--show_only_docker]
```

Where `<directory_path>` is the path to the directory to summarize, `<gitignore_path>` is the path to the .gitignore file to use, and `--show_docker` includes Docker files and `--show_only_docker` shows only Docker files.

## Examples

Summarize the contents of the current directory:

```
python summarize_directory.py .
```

Summarize the contents of a directory and exclude files listed in a .gitignore file:

```
python summarize_directory.py /path/to/directory --gitignore /path/to/.gitignore
```

Summarize the contents of a directory and include Docker files:

```
python summarize_directory.py /path/to/directory -d
```

Summarize the contents of a directory and show only Docker files:

```
python summarize_directory.py /path/to/directory -o
```

## Output

The tool generates a file called `Context_for_ChatGPT.md` in the specified directory with the summary of the directory's contents. The file includes a tree view of the directory's subdirectories and files, as well as the contents of each file. The tool also outputs a summary of the generated markdown, including the total number of lines, characters, and bytes.

## ChatGPT Prompt for Command:
-------
```
Given this:
python summarize_directory.py /path/to/directory --gitignore /path/to/.gitignore

Can you write me a prompt that implements these:
C:\dev\edge\Edge\plugins\storage_local
C:\dev\edge\Edge\.gitignore
```
-------
> Sure! Here's a prompt that implements those arguments:
> 
> ```
> python summarize_directory.py C:/dev/edge/Edge/plugins/storage_local --gitignore C:/dev/edge/> Edge/.gitignore
> ```
> 
> This prompt summarizes the contents of the `C:/dev/edge/Edge/plugins/storage_local` directory and excludes files listed in the `C:/dev/edge/Edge/.gitignore` file. The output will be saved in a file called `Context_for_ChatGPT.md` in the `C:/dev/edge/Edge/plugins/storage_local` directory.
